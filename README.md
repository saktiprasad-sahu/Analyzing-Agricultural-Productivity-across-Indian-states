"Analyzing Agricultural Productivity across Indian States 
Power BI" is a data-driven interactive dashboard designed to explore and evaluate the agricultural performance of various Indian states. 
This project leverages Power BIâ€™s powerful visualization tools to present key insights into crop yields, production trends, and regional variations across different states.
By integrating diverse datasets, the report allows users to filter and compare agricultural outputs by crop type, year, and state, offering a comprehensive view of productivity levels and identifying high-performing and underperforming regions. 
The dashboard aims to support data-informed decision-making for stakeholders in the agricultural sector, including policymakers, researchers, and farmers.
